# Movie App using Declarative UI : SwiftUI/Jetpack Compose/Flutter
This is an app implemented using SwiftUI/Flutter/Jetpack Compose to display the now playing and popular movies using The Movie Database API. The purpose of the project is to explore the similarities and differences of the 3 Declarative UI frameworks: SwiftUI, jetpack Compose and Flutter. The 3 apps have been developed based on a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern.
## Declarative UI
Martin Leblanc (iconfinder.com) said something recently about UI that sums it up perfectly: “A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it’s not that good.” We have all been spoiled by smartphones. UI technology has not only changed the world in which we live, it has advanced the ways in which we live in it. <br>Declarative UI increases the speed with which new technologies are developed, and allows for the seamless integration of the work of coders and designers. Declarative UI is a way of developing UIs by using declarative programming: a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. This is in contrast to imperative programming that uses statements that change a program’s state.
